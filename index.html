		<h2>Grading</h2>

		<p>Participation in <b>class discussions</b> will be an important factor for your final grade. I'll be looking to see that you have completed readings from the week before and are paying attention to the day's lesson.</p>

		<p><b>In-class exercises</b> are a prime opportunity to try out new skills. You'll be graded on effort (did the student try to complete the exercise to better understand the lesson at hand?) and, during group work, participation (did the student contribute?). </p>

		<p>You have four <b>major assignments</b>* this semester. In assessing your work, I'll take into account:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Process: Were the drafts iterated and improved based on faculty feedback?</li>
				<li>Quality: Is the assignment executed with skill and subtlety? Has it been edited and polished?</li>
				<li>Organization and presentation: Is work presented clearly and in a professional manner suitable for a news audience?</li>
				<li>Effort and application: Has the work been prepared with careful thought and attention to detail? Does it take appropriate advantage of the relevant tools?</li>
				<li>Punctuality and completeness: Was the assignment handed in on time? Is it complete and does it fulfill the assignment?</li>
			</ul>
		<p>*Specific criteria for each assignment will be detailed at a later date.</p>

		<p><b>How letter grades will be assigned:</b></p>

		<p>A: professional quality work, requiring minimal editing
		<br/>B: good quality work,requiring moderate editing and revisions
		<br/>C: unsatisfactory work, requiring heavy editing and revisions
		<br/>F: unacceptable, un-editable work</p>

		<p>Grading for the class as a whole will be based on your overall performance, with the weights of assignment and other grades as follows:</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>In-class participation</td>
					<td class='percent'>20%</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>In-class exercises</td>
					<td class='percent'>20%</td>

		<h2>Academic integrity</h2>

		<p>It is a serious ethical violation to take any material created by another person and represent it as your own original work. Any such plagiarism will result in serious disciplinary action, possibly including dismissal from the CUNY J-School. Plagiarism may involve copying text from a book or magazine without attributing the source, or lifting words, code, photographs, videos, or other materials from the Internet and attempting to pass them off as your own. Please ask the instructor if you have any questions about how to distinguish between acceptable research and plagiarism</p>

		<p>In addition to being a serious academic issue, copyright is a serious legal issue. Never "lift" or "borrow" or "appropriate" or "repurpose" graphics, audio, or code without both permission and attribution. This guidance applies to scripts, audio, video clips, programs, photos, drawings, and other images, and it includes images found online and in books.</p>

		<p>Create your own graphics, seek out images that are in the public domain or shared via a creative commons license that allows derivative works, or use images from the AP Photo Bank for which the school has obtained licensing. When in doubt about attribution, ask.</p>

		<h2>Extra resources</h2>

		<p>If you need help on a project, you can reach out to one of CUNY's coaches. Coaches work one-on-one with students to guide them through projects and help them problem-solve. Consult a coach if you've tried something for yourself, but it hasn't worked out to your satisfaction.</p>
